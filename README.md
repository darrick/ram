Radio Automation Machine scripts, configurations, etc.

Integration scripts and configurations for the OpenSourceRadio *Radio Automation Machine*.

Several ZSH scripts live in _usr/local/bin_ with configuration files in _usr/local/etc_.

Example Rivendell daemon control files are in _etc/systemd/system_; see the README in that directory for more details.
