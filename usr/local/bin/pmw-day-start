## Based partially on a message that was originally posted to
## rivendell-dev by Wayne Merricks <waynemerricks@thevoiceasia.com>
## with Subject: "[RDD] Getting Airplay to Auto Play at correct time"
##
## BUT ALERT: This script assumes that tomorrows log has already been prepared!
##
## This script does not start the next log, it simply loads tomorrows
## log and makes (what should be) the Legal ID the next cart to
## play. This is to work around the seemingly broken setting at
## rdadmin -> Manage Services -> "Insert CHAIN TO at log end". You
## should most likely DISABLE that setting when using this script and
## the associated RML Macro.
##
## This is meant to be run non-interactively from either a cron job,
## or from another job scheduler such as rdcatch(1) at several seconds
## before midnight.
##
## This script should run ON the host running RDAirPlay!
